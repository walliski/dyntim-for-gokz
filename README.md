# DynTim for GOKZ

Dynamic Timelimit for GOKZ. A small and simple plugin that will read the average map completion time for a map from the
local DB, and then try to calculate a more sensible timelimit based on that. This solves the problem of being stuck on
kz_mz for 30 minutes and having to spam rtv, vs. only having 30 minutes to complete kz_gy_agitation, and having to spam
extends.
